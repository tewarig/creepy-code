Nice work! Let’s iterate over what you’ve just learned about loops:

while loops: These are useful to repeat a code block an unknown number of times until some condition is met. For example:
int wishes = 0;

while (wishes < 3) {

  // code that will run
  wishes++;

}
for loops: These are ideal for when you are incrementing or decrementing with a counter variable. For example:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

  // code that will run

}
For-each loops: These make it simple to do something with each item in a list. For example:
for (String inventoryItem : inventoryItems) {

  // do something with each inventoryItem

}

Feel free to play around with loops, arrays, and ArrayLists in the code editor.
