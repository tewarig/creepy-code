We have now seen how to store a list of values in arrays. We can use this knowledge to make organized programs with more complex variables.

Throughout the lesson, we have learned about:

Creating arrays explicitly, using { and }.
Accessing an index of an array using [ and ].
Creating empty arrays of a certain size, and filling the indices one by one.
Getting the length of an array using length.
Using the argument array args that is passed into the main() method of a class.
